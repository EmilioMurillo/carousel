# carousel
This takes many images and displayes them in a form of a carousel. With options to click through the photos as (hence the title) a carousel.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JQuery

I created two functions. Both for left clicks and right clicks. These functions allow you to switch the photos going left or right. Each function was packed with logic that was definitley tough to come up with the first time.

## Lessons Learned:

I really struggled with creating this loop for the carousel. The logic was confsuing me using the lenght property. I am very happy to see that now there are more simple ways of doing the same thing. For example I could have used for loops or any other kid of loop instead of trying to rebuild it from scratch.
